# Challenge3-ServerAndDatabaseCommands

**Overview:** High-level repository for deliverables of the “Server and Database Commands” challenge. This repo hosts the technical documentation needed to retrieve research data from Google Scholar via an API provider and prepares the ground for subsequent sprints (Java MVC app and database integration).

---

## Project Purpose
Automate the retrieval of researcher and article information from Google Scholar (via an API provider) to support integration with the university’s research database.

## Key Functionalities (High-Level)
- Perform HTTP GET requests to Google Scholar through the API provider.
- Document endpoints, authentication, query parameters, response formats, usage limits, and minimal code examples.
- Provide a reference foundation for future work (Sprint 2 Java MVC, Sprint 3 database integration).

## Project Relevance
This project reduces manual data collection, standardizes how academic metadata is obtained, and facilitates reliable downstream integration into the institution’s research database.

## Documentation
- Technical Report (Sprint 1): [`docs/GoogleScholarAPI_TechnicalReport.md`](docs/GoogleScholarAPI_TechnicalReport.md)

> **Note:** Real API keys are not committed to this repository. Use environment variables or local config files listed in `.gitignore`.
